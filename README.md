TipCalculator

This is my first iOS assignment... Tip Calculator. App will accept Bill amount and let you select the tip amount and update the total amount you need
to pay. It also has settings page where you can set the default tip amount. It remembers user's preference for default tip and also dynamically updates
total amount if you choose between different tip option
